By default, a full-screen session is restricted to the monitor where it was launched. You can enable multi-monitor support through these settings, allowing the session to span across multiple monitors. If the remote desktop resolution exceeds the current monitor's resolution, the session will extend across adjacent screens. Note: Spanning is only supported across rectangular regionsâ€”if monitors have different vertical resolutions, the session will adjust to the shortest height. Additionally, the maximum resolution for the remote desktop is limited to 4096x2048.
